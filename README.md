ParetoPipe: A Framework for Pareto-Front Analysis of DNN Partitioning

ParetoPipe is an open-source framework designed to systematically benchmark and analyze the performance of distributed Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference across heterogeneous edge devices. This tool was developed for the research paper, 

"Where to Split? A Pareto-Front Analysis of DNN Partitioning for Edge Inference".

The core mission of ParetoPipe is to reframe DNN partitioning as a 

multi-objective optimization problem. Instead of focusing on a single metric like latency or throughput, our framework allows researchers and practitioners to explore the complex trade-off between these competing objectives. By identifying the 

Pareto frontier, ParetoPipe helps find all optimal partitioning strategies where one metric cannot be improved without degrading another
